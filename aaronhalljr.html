            <p>I guess I should start at the beginning as I remember it or as I remember how it was given to me...................I was born Aaron Hall Jr. to Maggie Melissa Moore Hall and to Aaron Hall who was born of Fred and Sarah Tyson Hall. I was the oldest of seven children. My mother had them in this order, Aaron Jr, Vernon Lee, Rose Mary, David Earl, Joyce Ann, Ronald Lee, and Linda Diane.</p>
            <h2>The first born was always responsible for the young-uns (your younger siblings).</h2>
            <p> I was told by my mother that she could not lay me on her breast for a long time because of the heat that came from my body. This didn&rsquo;t mean anything until I got much older. I will venture to say that I probably was born with a speech impediment. I say that because I can never remember when I did not stutter or stammer. I know now that God gave me this defect to make me depend on him. He honed other attributes within me; visions and dreams that others would never see. They could not see the countries I visited through the medium of reading and thought. They did not know the puzzles that I could solve because I was always thinking. The thoughts were vivid and told me &ldquo;that there is an answer to every problem.&rdquo; I could not talk, but God let me sing with that voice and gave me perfect pitch when I was a young man.</p>
            <p>Let me not get ahead of myself because Vernon and Rose Mary were a huge part of my enjoyment, singing. They allowed me to be part of three part harmony and so began, &ldquo;the Hall Singers.&rdquo; Our singing became most of our fun when we were very young (five, four, and three years old). Yes we formed the Hall Singers at those ages, of course I began to sing earlier, but all by myself. It was fun for me but it was more fun when we discovered that we could sing in three different notes that made this wonderful sound. This wonderful sound would become a fortress for our little lives. I mention singing because it has always carried me through my days upon this earth.</p>
            <p>We had each other until David Earl came along. David Earl could sing, but he was always too busy getting into trouble, which eventually got me this switching (chastised with the branches from a tree). I was the oldest, so I was responsible for the action of David Earl. I received many a whooping from my father because of David Earl and the others that followed but Vernon and Rose Mary gave me joy.</p>
            <h2>Singing has been handed down in the genes because my mother and father could sing.</h2>
            <p>I loved to hear my mother and her gospel group (True Light Gospel Singers) rehearse. The children were never allowed in the actual rehearsal, but we heard from another room or outside the window. My father sang also. His favorite song was &ldquo;Lord I&rsquo;m going to walk, walk that milky white- way o&rsquo; Lord one of these days.&rdquo; He had this great first tenor voice that was one of the tools that captured my mom. I never saw my father not dressed. He wore a suit, white shirt and tie, shined shoes and white socks every day. That well-dressed man had another side. A side that made him a monster to me at times. I say to me because it did not seem that way to some of my other siblings.</p>
            <p>My grandma was a big part of my life, both of them, but especially my mother&rsquo;s mother&mdash;Daisy Moore. Daisy taught me most of the things I know today. She taught us to cook, love God, groom ourselves, wash clothes, and care for each other. I still love the memory of her. She was a large woman with very large feet. She wore a man&rsquo;s size eleven. When she was around the house, she actually wore men shoes. But never mistake that for a lack of womanhood because she was all woman.</p>
            <p>I was born at 195 Wool Avenue, Portsmouth, Virginia, at my grandmother and grandfather&rsquo;s house. My grandfather was a man of small stature, quiet and refined. He and my grandmother looked awkward walking together, but they always walked together until he died. They were a great example in the neighborhood. Everyone knew them in the community and at Noble Street Baptist Church. They were the pillars of their church and seemed to always be able to sit in the same seats every time I went with them to church. That always impressed me because the church was always packed on Sundays. My grandmother kept a double barreled shot gun under the stair case. She ruled her home. During the years when I was born, babies were delivered in the home by a mid-wife. So all of us except my baby sister, Linda Diane, were born at home. Mid-wife, Grace delivered all of us. She was a woman with large hips, but quiet lips and tender hands. There were errors when registering birth certificates (my name was mistaken and written as Arson Hall Jr.<strong>)</strong> but you would always get some of that.</p>
            <p>My father could not read or write but he knew his name, big &ldquo;A,&rdquo; little &ldquo;a,&rdquo; &ldquo;ron.&rdquo; My brother Vernon and I have always been very close, not just because of our ages but because of our love for each other. We are and have been close to each other all of our lives. We lived in the same house a lot of our days on this earth and I enjoyed every moment of it. We went to Mt. Herman Elementary School. I was a year older, but I was smaller and shorter so they began to call me Lil. Bro. (little brother). That name stuck with me and I am still called that by many of my family members.</p>
            <p>Getting back to my grandmother (Daisy Moore, my mother&rsquo;s mother.) Grandma Daisy made sure that when Vernon and I went to school that we were groomed. She made us take baths every day and Vernon never liked it. He would do almost anything not to do it every .... day! She had this way of brushing our hair with a brush that she used to clean the floor. I loved her, but I hated when she asked me to get the brush. I still think my eyes are so big because of the way she brushed my hair. It hurt every time but that is how she controlled the kinks in my hair because Vernon&rsquo;s hair was much better than mine; for a long time he wore his hair in long braids. My grandmother placed a lock of his hair in her bible (the family bible). I always wanted to have hair like my brother and as I got older my hair changed into the same texture as his.</p>
            <p>School was wonderful to me because of the three cookies and the small container of milk that I received after our nap time in our class. Yes, the teacher said &ldquo;put your heads on your desk and go to sleep&rdquo; and we went to sleep as if we were all hypnotized. I have fond memories of my childhood especially in elementary school; recess (play-time), milk and cookies and my best friend at that time, Horace Franklin. Horace lived down the street from the school and I went to his house every day for lunch. I remember his mom making us hot dogs and French fries. We put hot sauce on everything, the hot dog and the French fries. Hot sauce tasted good on everything I ate, even to this day; okay, maybe not on everything.</p>
            <h2>I remember 195 Wool Avenue where we had a front porch from one end of the house to the other.</h2>
            <p> I entertained my friends on that porch and learned to roller skate on that porch. I sat on the porch and spoke to (tried to speak for I had a speech impediment) everyone that passed our home. It was the prettiest house on the block in my eyes; big white house with a white picket fence. We didn&rsquo;t have grass so we had to sweep the yard. Sweeping the yard was a chore that required technique. You took a hand-made broom (made with small branches from trees and tied with cord to make it useable) this broom swept in directions to form a design in the dirt that gave it some sense of beauty. I later found out that it was a way that my father could tell when we left the yard to go visit our friends. He saw our footprints going out and coming back in and chastised me and us accordingly. I soon learned to sweep myself out and sweep myself back into our yard.</p>
            <p>My grandmother&rsquo;s house was an old house that seemed to harbor spirits that had passed on and who would see them&mdash;my brother Vernon and I. We experienced many of the same things all of our lives and still do. My great grandmother died in the room that we slept in and we would see spirits going down steps and standing at the foot of our bed. I became afraid to sleep by myself so Vernon and I slept together and when David and Ronnie got older, all four of us slept in the same bed, two up and two down. We had to make sure that our feet were clean. I never saw how small my grandmother&rsquo;s house was until I moved from Portsmouth, Virginia and went back to the house years later. My grandmother preserved jellies, wines, pickled watermelon rinds, apple, grape, blackberry and strawberry preserves. Everything was grown in the backyard. The pecan tree, the walnut tree, the fig tree, all the different vegetables and some chickens. She also had many cats, house cats and yard cats; never the twain shall meet. I once threw a yard cat into the house and that cat knocked pots of food off the stove and broke many items in the house trying to get back out. My grandmother beat me every time she thought about the damage for days. I never forgot those beatings.</p>
            <p>My brother and I worked for Dave&rsquo;s store up on High Street and other stores handing out pamphlets. We handed out some and threw the rest down the sewer drains. Yes, I know it was wrong but we worked very hard for little gain. We brought bottles, cashed them in, to buy cookies and candy or just save our pennies until we could buy what we wanted. We have worked all our lives and many times the money went to the family, not into a savings account for ourselves.</p>
            <p>We were poor and at times we knew it because we only ate meat on Sundays. My dad cooked potatoes (boiled, stewed with onions, mashed, fried or baked) most of the time with fat-back (bad pieces of bacon, fat with a little streak of lean in it) or neck bones. We learned to like what most children would never eat. I enjoyed making ice cream or eating snow cream in the winter. We made things that made us happy. Sweet water (water and sugar), biscuits with syrup in the middle, banana sandwiches, mayonnaise sandwiches, jelly sandwiches, Kool-Aid. We were nurtured on the things that would kill most people; pigs feet, pig tails, pig ears, chopped barbeque, pork, pork and more pork.</p>
            <p>My sister, Rose Mary had worms because of our terrible diet of bad foods. I saw my grandmother pull a worm out of her, being careful not to pull it apart because it was vestigial and would just grow into another worm. In my little eyes, it appeared to be a snake. I loved my sister very much but as I said earlier, my father had another side. He would beat my mother because his father beat his wife and his grandfather also beat his wife. It was handed down from generation to generation. He beat my mother sometimes for trying to defend us. My sister Rose Mary was terrified of him and would at times, urinate on herself when we had to chase her down and bring her to our father. We were scared at times to even smile or say anything that might upset him and make him angry. He controlled us with fear and I hated it. I hated seeing my sister so upset that she would shake all over. She eventually died and I blamed him for it. We played marbles, made little roads out on dirt and pushed our little cars through imaginary streets. We played hop scotch and planned to sing (Vernon, Rose Mary and myself) forever. All of this was gone with her death, at least for me. I could not go to school after she died, for weeks. We visited her one night at the hospital and she died the next day. I just could not get over it. We were singing on Sunday mornings on Channel 10, a gospel television show. The Hall Singers were for real and now we were two. It would dissolve and never come together again. I was devastated! She was nine years old when she died and I was eleven. I was crushed, no more Rose Mary, no more beautiful soprano voice, no more hop-scotch, no more pretty smile on that sweet face of hers. It took time and I still saw my father as the reason for her death.</p>
            <p>After losing my sister Rose Mary they would bring the body back to the house because they didn&rsquo;t have funeral homes at that time. I thought it was heartless to bring the body back to the home. It felt like torture to me. I said to myself after that, I would always try to remember the person that passed away, like the last time I saw them and would never go up to view bodies. Maybe that is one of the things I learned in growing older.</p>
            <h2>We would go down south to Greenville, North Carolina every summer to live with my father&rsquo;s parents.</h2>
            <p> It wasn&rsquo;t city life; it was completely different from what we were accustomed to. It was farm land, no in-house toilet but an out-house, no more pancakes or eggs and bacon with orange juice. Breakfast was the largest meal on the farm and you ate about five or six in the morning; biscuits, chicken, fish, bacon, eggs, flour bread (cooked in skillet on the stove) molasses, jelly, well-water and cow&rsquo;s milk. Everyone worked on the farm. The men went out early in the morning and worked until night or late evening. They plowed the fields, plumed the rows (made sure each row was straight) seeded the fields. They planted corn, string beans, peas, potatoes, onions, snap beans, tomatoes, cotton, and tobacco. While they worked the fields we (I was about five or six when I took my first trip) slopped the pigs (took all the waste from the house in buckets with water mixture down to the pig pens). The smell of the waste was terrible but wonderful to the nose of the pigs. You had to be careful how you poured the mixture of waste and water into the troughs to make certain none splashed back onto you. If it splashed on you, you walked around with that smell all day because you only washed once a day in the same huge tub of water that everyone used to bathe in; hence &ldquo;don&rsquo;t throw the baby out with the bathwater&rdquo; the children washed last. The water was so dirty when you got into the tub. I hated that also. I was traumatized when my grandmother (Sarah Hall) would tell me to chase down a chicken that was my pet that day, and give it to her to kill. She would twist the chicken by the neck until its neck was in her hand and the body left running around headless. I was traumatized, how could this be? Going to the hen house was terrible for me because snakes were in there also. The house had a tin roof and you heard every rain drop every time it rained. You slept in close quarters and you played under the house (house rested on cinder blocks where chickens and children played together. The rooster ruled the barnyard and would often challenge my brother Vernon. I don&rsquo;t know why, maybe the rooster saw him as a threat. He would fly up into my brother&rsquo;s face and the face of others. I just wanted to go back home.</p>
            <p>The only consolation we had was riding in the back of a horse drawn wagon or a pallet of tobacco being pulled down to the tobacco barn with my brother and me on the pallet also being towed by a horse. That was the only fun I can remember other than going to my Uncle Fred&rsquo;s house. He was my daddy&rsquo;s older brother (a deacon in the church and a good man) we ate well there and were treated with love. I recalled one year we went to North Carolina and my grandfather (Fred Hall) sort of lost his mind and got naked. They did not have insane asylums to put him in, so they locked him in the shed. He somehow got free and found a butcher knife and came out shouting that he was hungry and wanted some meat. I saw him naked and crazed and I imagined that he saw me as a side of ham, and I, along with Vernon began to run. We ran from our house into the house of someone that we did not know to get away. I saw this man (Fred Hall) slap my grandmother (Sarah) and I had a fear of him as I had for my father and even more so. I had to get back to Grandma Daisy. She represented civilization as I knew it and I missed her every time I left to go to North Carolina. I later admired Grandma Sarah because she raised all her children in that house (all 13 of them) and endured the wrath of Fred Hall Sr.</p>
            <p>We moved a lot when we finally stopped going to North Carolina. We moved to Truxton and Douglass Park. I met Brenda Wilson and I thought I was in love with her. I was just eleven years old but I was in love! She never thought of me the way I thought of her but that was all right. I became good friends with her brother and we began to write songs together. One of the songs we wrote went something like this &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long time ago, but I still love you so. It&rsquo;s been a long time ago, but I still love you so. Darling I was so blue when you said we were through, it&rsquo;s been a long time ago. Why did we have to part, why did you break my heart, why did you hurt so, why did you have to go. It&rsquo;s been a long time ago, but I still love you so, it&rsquo;s been a long time ago, but I still love you so darling I was so blue when you said we were through it&rsquo;s been a long time ago.&rdquo; Brenda&rsquo;s brother was nick-named Bay Bro. So it was Lil. Bro. and Bay Bro. I found someone to sing with. It was short lived, but I will never forget it.</p>
            <p>It was like dreamland when we lived on Portsmouth Boulevard. We lived next door to Sylvia Harris and her family and across the street from Forest and his family. There were lawn parties quite often and they were great times. The neighborhood was filled with children our ages and we had people that we related to. There was this man Mr. Chambers that introduced us to Channel 10, the gospel TV station. He would pick us up and take us there to sing on Sunday mornings. We lived in a nice neighborhood with nice families and a few fresh girls. I stayed clear of them because as I said, I was in love with Brenda Wilson, but my brothers got caught up in the web of the naughty girls of Truxton. Brenda was like the Doris Day of Killian Avenue. She seemed so pure, not beautiful just pretty. She went her way and I went mine.</p>
            <p>My mother&rsquo;s sister, Aunt Rosa Short lived on Pinewell Avenue. She was one of the
            people that gave me fond memories. She was my mother&rsquo;s oldest sister and the protector of her family. She was also a story teller. When we lived in Douglass Park, we had to walk through these bushes to get to Pinewell and back to our house. We would go over to her house to eat and play with her children and others of the neighborhood. One night she told us the story of &ldquo;raw-head and bloody bones&rdquo; and I was terrified with the thought of walking home and going through those bushes. We only lived a few yards away from her but listening about raw-head and bloody bones, I just could not see maneuvering through those bushes because raw-head and bloody bones just might be in the bushes. I miss her stories and her humor.</p>
            <p>God later blessed our family with our own Aunt Rosa in the person of my sister Joyce Ann. She would light up any room that she entered and was the life of every party and family reunion or gathering. She also protected her family and took care of unruly children, whether hers or yours! She loved her family and that is why she would chastise them when she saw them going astray. &ldquo;Bend the tree while it is young&rdquo; was her motto. After the death of my sister Rose Mary, I felt that my father never hit the girls any more. Joyce only received love from him, but Joyce received love from everyone. Let me not paint my father as an ogre or a terrible person for he was not. He loved his immediate and extended family and was the icon of our family in Virginia and North Carolina. Whenever he showed up in town (Greenville, NC) he was swamped with family members that came to see &ldquo;Am Hall.&rdquo; All of his family called him &ldquo;Am.&rdquo; He was tall, dark and handsome. He could sing and dance and dressed well. Could not read or write until much later in his life but carried an aura of sophistication. His love for his family carried over into the very essence of his existence. Like so many men of the south, he imitated what he</p>
            <p>saw and what he thought was right at that time. He taught all of us at a very young age, to be clean and how to keep a neat house. He would tell us to clean the floor and come around with a white glove to check the cleanliness. He made me appreciate a neat and clean home. I found out later in life how much a neat house made me happy. A neat home is a comfortable and peaceful home if you are peaceful and loving. I thank God every day that I had a change of heart and attitude concerning my feelings toward my dad. They were borne from misunderstood bitterness that ate away at the fiber of a father-son relationship.</p>
            <p>I don&rsquo;t remember my mother that much as a child because she always worked and it was Grandma Daisy and I that took care of my family for a long time. I learned to cook at eight years old and was thrown into the role of caretaker for all of my siblings. We were very close because of it and are still today. I recall on one of our visits to Greenville when we had time to play, but we had no toys, so I made a doll for my sister Rose Mary with a clump of grass. I pulled a large clump of grass from the ground and took it over to a stream and washed the dirt out of the roots. The roots became the hair and the face and the grassy part became the dress for the doll. She was so happy and walked around talking to that clump of grass all day. We would take an old rim from a bike, take the spike out and get a stick and roll that rim with the stick all day. Whenever we got bored with one toy we would just invent or make another. We would ball ourselves up and get inside of a tire and take turns rolling each other around the dirt yard.</p>
            <p>Things that I learned on the farm have been topics for many of my sermons as a minister of God&rsquo;s word. I was told as a child to go over to the well and fetch a pail of water. When I reached the well I began to take the handle of the pump and move it up and down looking for water to come out. I learned from Grandma Sarah that you had to take a ladle of water and pour it down the mouth of the pump in order to get water out. That lesson gave me the topic for one of my sermons: &ldquo;You have to give in order to receive.&rdquo; &ldquo;In order to get milk you must push up and pull down on the udder.&rdquo; I learned so much from something that I hated as a child. Life is just one big learning experience; either you learn and apply or just let it fall on deaf ears and do nothing.</p>
            <p>I remember waiting for Sunday morning just to smell the aroma of my Grandma Daisy&rsquo;s baked rolls and knowing that later that day I would get one or two of them. We ate at the table every day. There were no distractions like TV or video games and even if there were, you reported to the table for dinner. Even though children were seen and not heard, in my grandma&rsquo;s house the children got food like the preacher did. We ate chicken also on Sunday afternoon. Yes, I was very partial to grandma because she always looked out for me and my siblings all of her life. I appreciate those things that she left with me and try to share them with my family and children.</p>
            <p>I learned to make many wonderful dishes by watching her cook and trying to copy the recipe. I did not always get them correct but I came pretty close. I enjoy watching people enjoy my cooking. I put love and attention to detail because of that lady. My mother had two sisters and four brothers that I was close to; Aunt Rosa, Aunt Doll, Uncle Bow, Uncle June, Uncle Dennis and Uncle Love. Each one of them contributed something to my life. Aunt Rosa was the storyteller and humorist. Aunt Doll was pretty (still is) and became my second mom at pivotal points in my life. Uncle Bow encouraged me to sing. Uncle June took me as a son and I admired the effect that he had on women and how he groomed his hair and cared about his appearance. Uncle Dennis took care of me for a while. He was the most feisty and mean one, but always cared for me. Uncle Love (the youngest) was the most educated one and I looked like I could have been his son. His son Wesley has my name (Aaron). I did not find that out until much later. My days as a child were vivid and filled with emotion.</p>
            <h2>I remember Christmas.</h2>
            <p> It wasn&rsquo;t always my most favorite time of the year because Santa never brought us what we wanted, but Grandma Daisy tried to make it special. We had socks that were always filled with candy, an apple, an orange and nuts. We got Christmas dinner, fruit cake and egg nog. She made it a special day for us. We did get leggings and a winter coat, so I guess we should have been grateful and we were. A Christmas came around when my sister got her doll. It was a large doll. It could have been her sister, rather than a baby and Vernon and I got a pair of skates for the both of us. Vernon wanted his own skate and wanted to let me have the other one but we couldn&rsquo;t learn with one skate so I convinced him to let me skate a while and he would skate a while. I loved those skates for the rest of my life. I still skate today whenever I have the time. I would skate everywhere. I thank my father every time I put on skates for that pair of skates and that Christmas. Skating gave me the same freedom and riding a bike; I could go places a little faster and enjoy the ride.</p>
            <p>When I entered S.H. Clark Junior High School, I felt a little more important and it made me feel more mature. It was a new school and because of that everything was shiny and smelled new. I loved my new locker and I loved the idea of changing classes. The thing I remembered the most was listening to a young lady compose the school song. I loved singing that song: &ldquo;Dear S.H. Clark, let us sing let our voices ring for all the things that we learn and do, we love our teachers all, we love our rooms and our halls yes we like it here. By all thy rules we&rsquo;ll abide and yes and we will strive to do the things that we&rsquo;re asked to do... Dear S.H Clark we love you.&rdquo; Singing that song every day was the highlight of my day. I enjoyed my teachers also and my fellow students. I took speech classes for my stuttering but nothing helped. I would talk slower and would try to enunciate but nothing seemed to work so I would retort to singing. Many people were shocked how I could sing and not talk. The stuttering was so bad that many of my teachers would say &ldquo;please little Aaron! Don&rsquo;t say it! Just write it on the blackboard.&rdquo; So I would write or depend on my brother Vernon, to relay what I wanted to say to others. He was my mouthpiece quite often. At home I would get smacked on the back of my head and I would hear my brother say, &ldquo;Spit it out boy.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Did I tell you about the football games at Portsmouth Stadium? My cousin Alonzo Short Jr. (Fang) attended I. C. Norcom High School and played on the senior varsity team. I learn to love football because of him and his friend, Truck. I never knew Truck&rsquo;s real name, but he was on the team also and practiced with my cousin all the time. Many days I would be over his house and I would be included in running patterns with them. I was short and skinny but I could run and catch. But going to watch a game at Portsmouth Stadium meant more than the game, it also meant buying fried crabs and peanuts. The man that created the batter for the fried crabs never gave the secret away to me or others; if he had, we would be rich today. I just loved the crabs and the dough. Going to I. C. Norcom High School was a dream of mine because of the campus and the reputation the school had for scholastics. I just wanted that kind of education and to walk up to get my diploma from that prestigious school. I was not the greatest student but I loved learning and I still do. I watch life and read books to learn what I did not know. I don&rsquo;t think that we ever stop learning as long as we live, we learn! You learn that you can do a cross word puzzle merely because we have heard or seen the answers to just about every question. We may have to call them to remembrance but they are there. We learn that we can do what another does if we are willing to learn what he has learned. We learn that women and men don&rsquo;t think alike or process the answers to problems alike. Men are from Mars and women from Venus. We learn to spell the word, phlegm! We learn that we are all equal and walk as if you know! It! We learn it is better to give than to receive, for if you give you will receive. That is why we call money, currency. Money must flow from you to others or ventures and it will come back to you, packed down, shaken together and running over into your bosom. We learn the golden rule &ldquo;do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&rdquo; You learn that if you can see it then you can have it. You learn that if you can envision it then you can achieve it.</p>
            <p>My family decided to move to New York because they believed that they could find better jobs there. Well, my Aunt Doll, my mother&rsquo;s baby sister said that she would keep me at her house so that I could stay back and attend I. C. Norcom High School. I. C. Norcom.... What can I say about that school? I was always very little for my age and having this speech impediment did not help my confidence. I could not communicate like the other kids, so I just got into my books and learned all that I could. After my aunt (second mother) enrolled me in school, I was walking down the hallway singing to myself and the music teacher, Mr. Lewis, heard me and asked me if I wanted to sing in the choir and he saw the effects of the stammering, felt sorry for me and said that he would change my schedule so that I could have music as one of my courses. I recall him introducing me to the class as if I was a doll. He picked me up and placed me on the stage and asked me to sing. The choir just sat there and listened as if they were in concert. I became the lead first tenor. I could sing soprano at that time, so my voice was very high. We only sang classical pieces. I was one of the few that could not read music but I learned by ear. We were in competition with other schools and won every year that I was there. I remember going to Virginia State to give a concert. I wore a tuxedo because I had a solo part. My recorder was stolen that night, but what I received was greater than my loss. I found out that night that God had given me something that the world could not touch because it was mine to share with others but it was comfort to me and has always been.</p>
            <p>I sit in my brother&rsquo;s home with such peace and joy because of the love that we have always had for each other and the love of my children that over shadows the sorrow of life and whatever disappointments it brings.
            <h2>As I have said throughout this story, music, the wonderful songs, the melodies of joy divine have sustained me thus far.</h2>
             <p>    Can I just say &ldquo;that I love the Lord with all my heart.&rdquo; Okay on with my story.</p>
            <p>Mister Lewis (the most wonderful music teacher in the world) had faith in me and cared for me like a father and I will never forget that. Going to I. C. Norcom was one of the highlights of my story. My Uncle Bernie (my aunt&rsquo;s husband ) also played a large part of my life) when my aunt brought him home to meet everyone, he was greeted by my grandmother, holding a double-barreled shot gun because she thought he was a white man (he had hazel eyes and straight hair like a Chinese). She was not going to have people saying that her daughter married a white man because that meant trouble. She told him &ldquo;You better turn around and leave this house right now!&rdquo; And the shot gun made him obey. It took a while for us to convince her that he was mixed. I am glad that she finally accepted him because he became my Uncle Bernie, my Uncle Bernie! He was mine until the day he died and so was his family. I would get excited every time my aunt would come home from working in New York. I would catch them making love often and would go out of the house so they never knew. I was happy to see such love in a house and admired their relationship. She would come on Friday and leave Sunday but it was always happy times. I was the only child in their home, so I received all the goodies and the attention. What a life I was living along with being popular in school.</p>
            <p>My aunt calls me from New York and tells me that my mom is asking me to come to New York. I did not want to leave but I had to go. My Uncle Bernie told me that he would come to New York to visit with me and he did but I was so sad leaving him. I got on the Greyhound Bus and went to New York and arrived at 42<sup>nd</sup> Street, frightened and crying. I was 14 years old, tanned by the sun of Virginia, so I was very dark. I wore pants that had a belt and suspenders. There was a rope around my suitcase to hold it shut. My father was supposed to meet me there but I saw no one that even resembled him. I waited and waited until I decided to stammer through a conversation with someone that told me how to get to Longwood Avenue, in the Bronx. They told me to &ldquo;go up the stairs to the Number 2, 3 or 4 trains and get off at Prospect Avenue.&rdquo; So I proceeded to walk through the bus terminal looking at a black boy walking with a white girl, feeling the urge to run over to him and warn him of such an act. This was forbidden in Virginia! Trying to keep my composure, I proceeded to find the subway train that would take me there. They told me to purchase a token (fifteen cents) and get on the train. I was trying to go up a down- escalator and a kind man told me to go around to the other side and there would be an escalator going up. So I obeyed and went up to the train station and purchased a token. Being ignorant to procedure, I saw a gate and just walked through it with my suitcase. Ironically, the train stopped right in front of me with the trainman&rsquo;s window in my face, so I offered him the token; he laughed at me and told me to just get on the train. I stumbled through a conversation asking the person next to me to point out the station where I was supposed to get off and they did just that. As soon as I got off onto the platform, my father was over on the other side going to meet me. I was so glad to see him that I just yelled and cried to get his attention. He was shocked to see that I had managed to find the stop. We hugged and proceeded to go to where we lived, at 836 Dawson Street.</p>
            <p>As we arrived at the building I started to go up the steps and my father said, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t live up there, we live down there.&rdquo; In my mind, I am saying &ldquo;we live under the ground.&rdquo; I could not comprehend that, but I just followed behind him, down a dark hallway and I heard the voices of my sisters and brothers and saw a dim light at the end of the hallway. What a wonderful sound! I saw my mother and the rest of the family and that took my mind off the idea of living under the ground. It was not what I thought it would be but I was with my family. In my mind I always saw an apartment with buttons to make the couch come out of the wall and clean streets. I was smack dab in the middle of Fort Apache, Kelly Street and Dawson Street. I did not know what I was in for. My father was superintendent of the building so I found myself pulling garbage from the top floor to the bottom. My brother and I took gunny-sack bags, large ones, walked to the top floor, and held the bags open while the tenants emptied their garbage into them from floor to floor. That was our jobs until we got a regular apartment. There were roaches and mice but we had each other.</p>
            <h2>I started Morris High School. They had no choir, so I felt lost.</h2> <p> I could never tell anyone how I really felt because of my impediment but God knew. I started smoking, drinking and using drugs. When I took my first drag on a cigarette, my father smelled the smoke and made me smoke one of his (Pall Malls). I had to inhale until I passed out and got sick. He said, &ldquo;Oh, you want to be a man huh?&rdquo; That was the start of a good boy going into training to become a badd boy. Bad, I was and stupid besides. I did well in school, but I was stuck in stupid outside of school. I was forced to join a neighborhood gang or get beat up every day. I still had a southern drawl, so I did not say ball but bawl. The Collegian Crowns, what a name for a gang. Such a smart name for a group of ignorant boys. Sometimes you become a product of your environment and that is what happened to me. The one good thing about the buildings on Dawson Street was the acoustics. You did not need a mike for everyone in the building to hear you. I would sing for free because music was the one thing that took me through the ghetto of the South Bronx. </p>
            <p>I met my best friend, Anthony Bertty, walking on Stebbins Avenue singing &ldquo;Up on the roof.&rdquo; I was singing on one side of the street and he began to harmonize with me on the other side. That started a friendship that has endured a lifetime. I lived in fear all the time because someone died almost every week. They were thrown from the roof tops of buildings, stabbed, shot, hit in heads with baseball bats, overdosed on drugs or some other means. I walked every day looking over my shoulder. I became a product of gang warfare and rebellion. Mrs. Bertty (Anthony&rsquo;s mom) was my second mother. She fed me and gave me a sense of family outside of the gang system. The gang was never my family, just a necessary evil. I met James Perry (Jamil Abdulah), he had a limp but was a very handsome boy. I later met another Jim Perry. He was the vehicle that was used to get me to Wall Street (Salomon Brothers and Hutzler) and my first real job. I would go over to Anthony&rsquo;s house and I was in a whole new world even though it was just across the street. Just across the street there was a haven just for me (it was for others also) at least I took him and his family as the kind of environment that I wanted and loved. Mrs. Bertty assured me that as long as she was alive, I could be part of her family; so did the two Perrys and their families. I finally had some place to go to that took me away from gangs and the trappings of violence. </p>
            <h2>I started a singing group with Anthony, James Perry and two other guys.</h2>
            <p> I finally found an oasis of freedom; freedom to express myself in song. We wrote a lot of our own songs and arrangements we were a group! Back on Dawson Street the talk was of who died last night or got injured. Just across street, God had set up a place of peace for me. Most of my friends that lived on that block or went to school with me have since then, died. I only have Anthony Bertty and his wife from that time. Oh yes, his brothers and sister are still living in other states but Anthony and I are the best of friends.</p>
